# MACL
This is the implementation for the paper:

_Rethinking Contrastive Learning in Session-based Recommendation_

at _Pattern Recognition (PR) 2025_, 

Datasets:

Amazon http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/

Instacart https://www.kaggle.com/c/instacart-market-basket-analysis

We also uploaded all three preprocessed datasets under the folder 'datasets'. You can directly use them to reproduce our results.

Note that, based on accessibility, the multi-modal features we incorporate in Cellphones and Grocery are item images and text, while using item text for Instacart. For convenience, we seperate the files to run MACL for different settings, where you can run main.py for Cellphones/Grocery, and mainSingle.py for Instacart.

In case that you have any difficulty about the implementation or you are interested in our work,  please feel free to communicate with us by:
